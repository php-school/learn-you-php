Write a program that prints the text "Hello World" to the console (stdout).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## HINTS

To make a PHP program, create a new file with a `.php` extension and start writing PHP! Execute your program by running it with the
`php` command. e.g.:

```sh
$ php program.php
```

You can write to the console like so:

```php
<?php
echo "text";
```

When you are done, you must run:

```sh
$ {appname} verify program.php
```

to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
