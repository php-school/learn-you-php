Write a program that prints the text "Hello World" to the console (stdout).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## HINTS

To make a PHP program, create a new file with a `.php` extension and start writing PHP! Execute your program by running it with the
`php` command. e.g.:

```sh
$ php program.php
```

You can write to the console from a PHP program with the following code:

```php
<?php
echo "text";
```

The first line tells the PHP to interpret the code following it. It is required before any PHP code is written. Read more here: [http://php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.phptags.php]()
The second line is the instruction to print out some text.

Place the code in to a text file using your favourite text editor, some popular editors are listed below:

* Sublime Text: [https://www.sublimetext.com/]()
* Atom: [https://atom.io/]()

Switch back to the terminal and run your code again with the same command as above:

```sh
$ php program.php
```

You should see the word "text" printed out on the console.

Now you must adapt the code to pass the challenge presented. Remember the challenge was: Write a program that prints the text "Hello World" to the console (stdout).

We have created you a file named `hello-world.php` in your current working directory, feel free to use it!

When you have finished and saved the file you must run the following (substituting program.php to the name of the file you created which contains your code)

```sh
$ {appname} verify program.php
```

to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
